factorial returns int with n as int is [
    if (n == 0) [
        return 1 as int
    ] else [ 
        return n * factorial(n - 1) as int
    ]
],
declare zero as int,
// funct main
main returns int is [
    declare number as int
    declare fact as int
    declare result as float

    number is 5

    if (number == 5) [
        fact is factorial(number)
     ] else [ 
        fact is 0
     ]

    result is fact * 1.0

    while (result >= 1.0) [
        result is result - 0.5
    ]

    return fact as int
];
